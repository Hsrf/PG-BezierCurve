# PG-BezierCurve
Simple project to create interactive Bezier Curves in javascript. (This my first ever web project)

In order to delete points, the user must select the 'selecionar' checkbox as well as the 'deletar' checkbox and then click on the point you wish to delete.

You'll know which is the current curve by looking at the counter at the bottom of the canvas

Any doubts, email me at hsrf@cin.ufpe.br
